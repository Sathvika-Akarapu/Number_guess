Number Guessing Game 🎉
Welcome to the Ultimate Number Guessing Showdown! 🕵️‍♂️

Can you guess the secret number between 1 and 100? The catch? The number might be a tricky little rascal, and you only get a handful of chances to find it. 😏
How to Play:

    Run the game using Node.js (v14 or higher).

    Pick your difficulty level:

        Easy: You get 10 shots. (Because who doesn't love an easy win? 😉)

        Medium: A 5-chance challenge. 🧐 (Let’s turn up the heat.)

        Hard: Only 3 attempts. (Brace yourself. It’s about to get real. 😬)

    Enter your guesses, and I’ll throw in some hints.
    Keep guessing until you either nail it or run out of attempts! 😱

Requirements:

    Node.js (v14 or higher)

    readline module (It’s built-in, so you’re already good to go! ✌️)

Code Structure 🧑‍💻
